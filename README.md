# Fingerprint Matching
This Python script utilizes the OpenCV library to perform fingerprint matching between a sample fingerprint image and a set of real fingerprint images. The script uses the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm for feature detection and matching.

 # Features:
* Loads a sample fingerprint image and resizes it for processing.
* Iterates through a directory containing real fingerprint images.
* Computes SIFT keypoints and descriptors for both the sample and real fingerprint images.
* Uses a FLANN-based matcher to find matching keypoints between the sample and real images.
* Filters good matches based on a ratio test.
* Calculates a match score as a percentage of matching keypoints.
* Identifies the best match among the real fingerprint images.
* Draws the matched keypoints and displays the result.
# Usage:
* Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
* Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
* Run the script by executing python main.py.
* Provide the path to the sample and real fingerprint images as required.
# Dependencies:
* OpenCV (cv2)
# Note:
* This script is designed for educational purposes and may require customization for specific use cases or datasets.
